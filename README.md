# BMI calculator
in this project we are going to create a project that calculates BMI

measurements:

1.weight(Kgs)

2.Height(m)

BMI = weight/(Height  * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine the user is overweight, normal or underweight     
This is the last edit.


## Results:

if BMI > 25 then the person is overweight

if BMI is between 18 and 25, the person is normal

if BMI < 18 then the person is underweight

Thank you!

# We have created a branch called new-features
